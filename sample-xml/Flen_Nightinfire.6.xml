                    <description>You can appraise common or well-known objects with a DC 12 Appraise check. Failure means that you estimate the value at 50% to 150% of its actual value.

Synergy: If you have 5 ranks in any Craft skill, you gain a +2 bonus to Appraise checks related to items made with that craft skill.</description>

This includes ignoring wounds from caltrops, memorizing large amounts of data, resisting death and fear, tolerating poison, and operating while disabled (at 0 hit points).

                    <description>You are a skilled officer and manager of troops.  You can command others effectively on the field of battle.

Check While the Knowledge (history) skill can represent a knowledge of warfare and tactics, this skill represents battlfield cunning and the ability to put tactics into action.  This skill also represents a general familiarity with tactics and can be used to perform any of the following actions.

Find Advantage: Once per round as a free action you may use this skill to find the quickest route to higher ground, cover, concealment, or an effective place to hide (gaining a +2 circumstance bonus to any Bluff checks used to create a diversion to hide this round).

Hunch: A successful check can reveal whether the enemy is fighting defensively to delay you, intends to concentrate on a specific objective, or simply wishes to retreat.  (If you have 5 or more ranks in Sense Motive, you gain a +2 synergy bonus to this check.)

Recognize Ambush: This use of the skill allows you to recognize areas that would make effective ambush points, allowing you to either avoid an ambush or organzie one of your own.  This only bestows a general wariness; detecting hidden attackers still requires a successful Spot check.

Find Weakness: An opposed Battle check against the leader of an enemy army to find a weakness in the opponent's strategy.

Battle Task            DC
Find Advantage           15
Hunch                            20
Recognize Ambush   20
Find Weakness          Variable

                    <description>Your Hide check is opposed by the Spot check of anyone who might see you.

                <skill name="Hypnosis" attrbonus="2" attrname="Charisma" value="2" ranks="0" trainedonly="yes" usable="no">
                    <description>You have studied the hidden workings of the human mind and can unlock its secrets.

Check: You can use hypnosis to induce a deep, calming trance in your subject. The effects of a hypnotic trance are identical to those created by the hypnotism spell.

Unlike the spell, however, the skill allows you to hypnotize only one target at a time, who does not receive the -2 penalty to her Will save. Each attempt to use hypnosis requires 1 hour. If the target is unwilling, you must first succeed at a Bluff check to disguise your intent.

A Hypnosis check is opposed by the target's Will save. Loud or distracting surroundings grant a +2 circumstance modifier to the target's Will save. Willing targets can voluntarily choose not to make their saving throw.

Once the target is hypnotized, you can either plant a suggestion (as per the hypnotism spell) or aid the recovery of a target who suffers from the effects of a failed Madness save. The latter option is detailed under "Recovering from Madness" in chapter 3.

Retry: Generally, you cannot retry a Hypnosis check against an unwilling target; the target becomes too suspicious to cooperate. If attempting to hypnotize a willing target, you may retry freely. Retries are a vital component in the process of helping targets recover from Madness effects, in fact.</description>

Your Intimidate check is opposed by the target's modified level check (1d20 + character level or Hit Dice + target's Wisdom bonus [if any] + target's modifiers on saves against fear). If you beat your target's check result, you may treat the target as friendly, but only for the purpose of actions taken while it remains intimidated.

Synergy: If you have 5 or more ranks in Bluff, you get a +2 bonus on Intimidate checks.</description>
                </skill>
                <skill name="Jump" attrbonus="0" attrname="Strength" value="0" ranks="0" armorcheck="yes">

Action: Varies, as noted above.

Try Again: See above.

Special: A swordsage gains a +2 bonus on a Martial Lore check involving a maneuver in a discipline in which he has discipline focus.</description>

                <skill name="Mimic" attrbonus="2" attrname="Charisma" value="2" ranks="0" trainedonly="yes" usable="no">
                    <description>You can reproduce the voices of others, or the sounds made by creatures you have heard.

Check: You can attempt to disguise your voice as that of another person, or trick others into believing they have heard whatever creature sound you wish to mimic.

Anyone that hears you must make an opposed Listen check to realize that what they are hearing is not authentic.

Retry: Generally, once you have failed to fool a target you cannot fool him again.  Any further Mimic checks (emulating other voices or noises) against the same person during that encounter suffer a -2 penalty.

Special: If you have 6 or more ranks in Listen, you receive a +2 synergy bonus on Mimic checks.</description>

                <skill name="Monster Lore: Dragons" attrbonus="2" attrname="Intelligence" value="2" ranks="0">
                    <description>Lore skills mix academic study with a broad overview of legend and superstition. Characters can attempt to use lore skills untrained (an Intelligence check, which the DM should roll) by relying on their knowledge of common folklore. However, folklore is often misleading. If a character trained in lore fails the skill check, she realizes that she simply does not know the needed information.

Benefit: You can create a potion of any 3rd-level or lower spell that you know and that targets one or more creatures. Brewing a potion takes one day.

The base price of a potion is its spell level x its caster level x 50 gp. To brew a potion, you must spend 1/25 of this base price in XP and use up raw materials costing one half this base price.
When you create a potion, you make any choices that you would normally make when casting the spell. Whoever drinks the potion is the target of the spell.
Any potion that stores a spell with a costly material component or an XP cost also carries a commensurate cost. In addition to the costs derived from the base price, you must expend the material component or pay the XP when creating the potion.</description>

                    <description>A Medium character deals 1d3 points of nonlethal damage with an unarmed strike. A Small character deals 1d2 points of nonlethal damage. A monk or any character with the Improved Unarmed Strike feat can deal lethal or nonlethal damage with unarmed strikes, at her option. The damage from an unarmed strike is considered weapon damage for the purposes of effects that give you a bonus on weapon damage rolls.

An unarmed strike is always considered a light weapon. Therefore, you can use the Weapon Finesse feat to apply your Dexterity modifier instead of your Strength modifier to attack rolls with an unarmed strike. </description>

                    <description>This appears to be a common cloth sack about 2 feet by 4 feet in size. The bag of holding opens into a nondimensional space

Bag - Bag Weight - Contents Weight Limit - Contents Volume Limit - Market Price

Type I - 15 lb. - 250 lb. - 30 cu. ft. - 2,500 gp

Type II - 25 lb. - 500 lb. - 70 cu. ft. - 5,000 gp

Type III - 35 lb. - 1,000 lb. - 150 cu. ft. - 7,400 gp

Type IV - 60 lb. - 1,500 lb. - 250 cu. ft. - 10,000 gp

If the bag is overloaded, or if sharp objects pierce it (from inside or outside), the bag ruptures and is ruined. All contents are lost forever. If a bag of holding is turned inside out, its contents spill out, unharmed, but the bag must be put right before it can be used again. If living creatures are placed within the bag, they can survive for up to 10 minutes, after which time they suffocate. Retrieving a specific item from a bag of holding is a move action - unless the bag contains more than an ordinary backpack would hold, in which case retrieving a specific item is a full-round action.

If a bag of holding is placed within a portable hole a rift to the Astral Plane is torn in the space: Bag and hole alike are sucked into the void and forever lost. If a portable hole is placed within a bag of holding, it opens a gate to the Astral Plane: The hole, the bag, and any creatures within a 10-foot radius are drawn there, destroying the portable hole and bag of holding in the process.

                    <description>Acid Neutralizer reduces the strength of non magical acid, such as the typ found in a variety of common dungeon traps.

DESCRIPTION:  Acid neutralizer is a slippery white substance similar in appearance to soap.  It is made and sold in fist-sized lumps wrapped in brown wax paper.  When dropped in acide, the neutralizer foams and fizzles, turbulently churning the acid for 5 seconds.  Neutralized acid takes on the appearance of weakly colored water, retaining only a slight tint and no odor whatsoever.

ACTIVATION:  To use a lump of acid neutralizer, just drop it into a vessel containing acid (a free action). Unwraping the lump is not necessary, because any acid strong enough to warrant neutralization will eat through the paper wrapping easily.  Neutralization requires a full round and the acid will remain at full strength until the start of your next turn.

If you are immersed in acid while carrying lumps of acid neutralizer, they immediately activate unless stored in a stronger container, such as a metal tin.  Being splashed by acid might activate the neutralizer if you keep it exposed, rather than stored in a jar.  

EFFECT:  If you drop one lump of acid neutralizer into a container holding up to 10 cubic feet of non magical acid, the acid is permanently weakened such that contact with the acid deals no damage.  Complete immersion in neutralized acid deals only 5d6 points of damage (instead of 10d6 points).  Acid that has been neutralized in this manner no longer gives off toxic fumes (DMG 302).  Larger volumes of acid require additional doses; two lumps are needed to neutralize 20 cubic foot vat of acid.

Neutralizer is far less effective against magic acids, which regain their full acidity after 3d6 rounds.

If you wear a lump of acid neutralizer in a necklace or carry it otherwise exposed on your body, the lump prevents continuing damage from acid attacks for 1 minute after initial exposure.  It has no effect against the initial damage dealt by an acid attack.

Construction:  DC 20 Craft (alchemy) check, 17 gp.</description>

                    <description>Holy water damages undead creatures and evil outsiders almost as if it were acid. A flask of holy water can be thrown as a splash weapon.
Treat this attack as a ranged touch attack with a range increment of 10 feet. A flask breaks if thrown against the body of a corporeal creature, but to use it against an incorporeal creature, you must open the flask and pour the holy water out onto the target. Thus, you can douse an incorporeal creature with holy water only if you are adjacent to it. Doing so is a ranged touch attack that does not provoke attacks of opportunity.
A direct hit by a flask of holy water deals 2d4 points of damage to an undead creature or an evil outsider. Each such creature within 5 feet of the point where the flask hits takes 1 point of damage from the splash.
Temples to good deities sell holy water at cost (making no profit).</description>

                <special name="Turn Undead (5/day) (Su)" type="Supernatural Ability">
                    <description>Good clerics and paladins and some neutral clerics can channel positive energy, which can halt, drive off (rout), or destroy undead. Evil clerics and some neutral clerics can channel negative energy, which can halt, awe (rebuke), control (command), or bolster undead. Regardless of the effect, the general term for the activity is "turning." When attempting to exercise their divine control over these creatures, characters make turning checks.

Turning Checks
Turning undead is a supernatural ability that a character can perform as a standard action. It does not provoke attacks of opportunity. You must present your holy symbol to turn undead. Turning is considered an attack.

Times per Day
You may attempt to turn undead a number of times per day equal to 3 + your Charisma modifier. You can increase this number by taking the Extra Turning feat.

Range
You turn the closest turnable undead first, and you canâ€™t turn undead that are more than 60 feet away or that have total cover relative to you. You donâ€™t need line of sight to a target, but you do need line of effect.

Turning Check
The first thing you do is roll a turning check to see how powerful an undead creature you can turn. This is a Charisma check (1d20 + your Charisma modifier). Table: Turning Undead gives you the Hit Dice of the most powerful undead you can affect, relative to your level. On a given turning attempt, you can turn no undead creature whose Hit Dice exceed the result on this table.

Turning Damage
If your roll on Table: Turning Undead is high enough to let you turn at least some of the undead within 60 feet, roll 2d6 + your cleric level + your Charisma modifier for turning damage. Thatâ€™s how many total Hit Dice of undead you can turn. If your Charisma score is average or low, itâ€™s possible to roll fewer Hit Dice of undead turned than indicated on Table: Turning Undead. You may skip over already turned undead that are still within range, so that you do not waste your turning capacity on them.

Effect and Duration of Turning
Turned undead flee from you by the best and fastest means available to them. They flee for 10 rounds (1 minute). If they cannot flee, they cower (giving any attack rolls against them a +2 bonus). If you approach within 10 feet of them, however, they overcome being turned and act normally. (You can stand within 10 feet without breaking the turning effect-you just canâ€™t approach them.) You can attack them with ranged attacks (from at least 10 feet away), and others can attack them in any fashion, without breaking the turning effect.

Destroying Undead
If you have twice as many levels (or more) as the undead have Hit Dice, you destroy any that you would normally turn.</description>

                <special name="Type - Humanoid">
                    <description>A humanoid usually has two arms, two legs, and one head, or a humanlike torso, arms, and a head. Humanoids have few or no supernatural or extraordinary abilities, but most can speak and usually have well-developed societies. They usually are Small or Medium. Every humanoid creature also has a subtype.

Humanoids with 1 Hit Die exchange the features of their humanoid Hit Die for the class features of a PC or NPC class. Humanoids of this sort are presented as 1st-level warriors, which means that they have average combat ability and poor saving throws.

Humanoids with more than 1 Hit Die are the only humanoids who make use of the features of the humanoid type.

Features: A humanoid has the following features (unless otherwise noted in a creatureâ€™s entry).
â€”8-sided Hit Dice, or by character class.
â€”Base attack bonus equal to 3/4 total Hit Dice (as cleric).
â€”Good Reflex saves (usually; a humanoidâ€™s good save varies).
â€”Skill points equal to (2 + Int modifier, minimum 1) per Hit Die, with quadruple skill points for the first Hit Die, or by character class.

Traits: A humanoid possesses the following traits (unless otherwise noted in a creatureâ€™s entry).
â€”Proficient with all simple weapons, or by character class.
â€”Proficient with whatever type of armor (light, medium, or heavy) it is described as wearing, or by character class. If a humanoid does not have a class and wears armor, it is proficient with that type of armor and all lighter types. Humanoids not indicated as wearing armor are not proficient with armor. Humanoids are proficient with shields if they are proficient with any form of armor.
â€”Humanoids breathe, eat, and sleep.</description>

                    <description>Your ally falls from a crushing blow, but you donâ€™t have time to reach him. You quickly speak words of power, and the worst of his injuries glow golden and begin to heal. 

This spell cures 1d4 points of damage +1 point per caster level (maximum +5).

If you cast this spell immediately after the subject takes damage, it effectively prevents the damage. It would keep alive someone who had just dropped to â€“10 hit points, for example, leaving the character at negative hit points but stable.

Used against an undead creature, close wounds deals damage instead of curing the creature (which takes half damage if it makes a Will saving throw).</description>

Note: Conjuration spells can't create substances or objects within a creature. Water weighs about 8 pounds per gallon. One cubic foot of water contains roughly 8 gallons and weighs about 60 pounds.</description>

                    <description>You stand at the edge of the canyon and invoke the power. At your feet appears a thin black bridge that arches over the canyon. 

You create a ribbonlike, weightless, unbreakable bridge. A dark way must be anchored at both ends to solid objects, but otherwise can be at any angle. Like a wall of force (PH 298), it must be continuous and unbroken when formed. It is typically used to cross a chasm or a hazardous space. Creatures can move on a dark way without penalty, since it is no more slippery than a typical dungeon floor.

A dark way can support a maximum of 200 pounds per caster level. Creatures that cause the total weight on a dark way to exceed this limit fall through it as if it werenâ€™t there. You never fall through a dark way unless your own weight exceeds the spellâ€™s maximum capacity.

Also known as Bridge of sound.</description>

                    <description>Your hand feels warm cupping the eldritch flames. You cannot see the fire in the shadows, but you know it is there, as will those who will soon feel the hungry flames. 

Dark flames appear in your hand. You can hurl them or use them to touch enemies. The flames appear in your open hand and harm neither you nor your equipment. They emit no light but produce the same amount of heat as an actual fire.

Beginning the following round, you can strike opponents with a melee touch attack, dealing 1d6 points of fire damage per two caster levels (maximum 5d6). Alternatively, you can hurl the flames up to 120 feet as a thrown weapon. When doing so, you make a ranged touch attack (with no range penalty) and deal the same damage as with the melee attack. No sooner do you hurl the flames than a new set appears in your hand.

The darkfire is invisible to normal vision but can be seen with darkvision as easily as a normal flame can be seen in darkness (this means that darkfire can be used as a signal or beacon for creatures with darkvision).

The spell does not function underwater.</description>

                    <description>You detect magical auras. The amount of information revealed depends on how long you study a particular area or subject.

1st Round: Presence or absence of magical auras.

2nd Round: Number of different magical auras and the power of the most potent aura.

3rd Round: The strength and location of each aura. If the items or creatures bearing the auras are in line of sight, you can make Spellcraft skill checks to determine the school of magic involved in each. (Make one check per aura; DC 15 + spell level, or 15 + half caster level for a nonspell effect.)

Magical areas, multiple types of magic, or strong local magical emanations may distort or conceal weaker auras.

Aura Strength: An aura's power depends on a spell's functioning spell level or an item's caster level. If an aura falls into more than one category, detect magic indicates the stronger of the two.

Aura Power
Source - Faint - Moderate - Strong - Overwhelming
Spell- 0 - 3rd-4th-6th-7th-9th-10th+
Magic item-1st-5th-6th-11th-12th-20th- 21st+

Lingering Aura: A magical aura lingers after its original source dissipates (in the case of a spell) or is destroyed (in the case of a magic item). If detect magic is cast and directed at such a location, the spell indicates an aura strength of dim (even weaker than a faint aura). How long the aura lingers at this dim level depends on its original power:

Original Strength - Duration of Lingering Aura
Faint - 1d6 rounds
Moderate - 1d6 minutes
Strong - 1d6x10 minutes
Overwhelming - 1d6 days

Outsiders and elementals are not magical in themselves, but if they are summoned, the conjuration spell registers.

Each round, you can turn to detect magic in a new area. The spell can penetrate barriers, but 1 foot of stone, 1 inch of common metal, a thin sheet of lead, or 3 feet of wood or dirt blocks it.

Detect magic can be made permanent with a permanency spell.</description>

                    <description>The subject can fly at a speed of 60 feet (or 40 feet if it wears medium or heavy armor, or if it carries a medium or heavy load). It can ascend at half speed and descend at double speed, and its maneuverability is good. Using a fly spell requires only as much concentration as walking, so the subject can attack or cast spells normally. The subject of a fly spell can charge but not run, and it cannot carry aloft more weight than its maximum load, plus any armor it wears.

Should the spell duration expire while the subject is still aloft, the magic fails slowly. The subject floats downward 60 feet per round for 1d6 rounds. If it reaches the ground in that amount of time, it lands safely. If not, it falls the rest of the distance, taking 1d6 points of damage per 10 feet of fall. Since dispelling a spell effectively ends it, the subject also descends in this way if the fly spell is dispelled, but not if it is negated by an antimagic field.</description>

                    <description>Your will clamps down on the subject's mind, making the slightest movement a strenuous effort. 

This spell locks the subject in place. An affected creature is capable of taking actions, such as attacking or casting spells, but it cannot step from its current square (or squares, if it occupies more than one). The subject also takes a -1 penalty on melee attack rolls and a -2 penalty on Reflex saves while so rooted. The penalties imposed by this spell are sacred (if your deity is good or neutral) or profane (if your deity is evil).

If the subject succeeds on the initial Will save, it suffers no ill effects and the spell ends immediately. If it fails the initial save, it can attempt a new Will save every round thereafter. Once the subject succeeds on one of these secondary saves, it can move, but its base speed is reduced by 10 feet (to a minimum of 5 feet) for the duration of the spell. If the subject has multiple modes of movement, each is reduced accordingly. 

If the subject is already under an effect that curtails its ability to move (such as slow or hold person), it also takes a -4 penalty to Dexterity for the duration of this spell, even if the other effect ends before this one does.</description>

Since undead are powered by negative energy, this spell deals damage to them instead of curing their wounds. Any undead creature can apply spell resistance and attempt a Will save to take half damage.</description>

You enable a creature to better fight off the effect of poison. The subject is filled with antitoxin and gains a +5 alchemical bonus on Fortitude saves against all kinds of poisons, whether injury, contact, ingestion, or inhalation. After the spell ends, the subject is nauseated for 1 round.</description>

                    <description>This spell wards a creature from attacks by evil creatures, from mental control, and from summoned creatures. It creates a magical barrier around the subject at a distance of 1 foot. The barrier moves with the subject and has three major effects.

First, the subject gains a +2 deflection bonus to AC and a +2 resistance bonus on saves. Both these bonuses apply against attacks made or effects created by evil creatures.

Second, the barrier blocks any attempt to possess the warded creature (by a magic jar attack, for example) or to exercise mental control over the creature (including enchantment (charm) effects and enchantment (compulsion) effects that grant the caster ongoing control over the subject, such as dominate person). The protection does not prevent such effects from targeting the protected creature, but it suppresses the effect for the duration of the protection from evil effect. If the protection from evil effect ends before the effect granting mental control does, the would-be controller would then be able to mentally command the controlled creature. Likewise, the barrier keeps out a possessing life force but does not expel one if it is in place before the spell is cast. This second effect works regardless of alignment.

Third, the spell prevents bodily contact by summoned creatures. This causes the natural weapon attacks of such creatures to fail and the creatures to recoil if such attacks require touching the warded creature. Good summoned creatures are immune to this effect. The protection against contact by summoned creatures ends if the warded creature makes an attack against or tries to force the barrier against the blocked creature. Spell resistance can allow a creature to overcome this protection and touch the warded creature.</description>

                    <description>By means of read magic, you can decipher magical inscriptions on objects - books, scrolls, weapons, and the like - that would otherwise be unintelligible. This deciphering does not normally invoke the magic contained in the writing, although it may do so in the case of a cursed scroll. Furthermore, once the spell is cast and you have read the magical inscription, you are thereafter able to read that particular writing without recourse to the use of read magic. You can read at the rate of one page (250 words) per minute. The spell allows you to identify a glyph of warding with a DC 13 Spellcraft check, a greater glyph of warding with a DC 16 Spellcraft check, or any symbol spell with a Spellcraft check (DC 10 + spell level).

Read magic can be made permanent with a permanency spell.</description>

                <spell name="Spiritual Weapon" level="2" class="Cleric" casttime="1 Action" range="Medium (100 + 10 ft./level" duration="1 round/level (D)" save="None" resist="Yes" componenttext="Verbal, Somatic, Divine Focus" schooltext="Evocation" subschooltext="Force" castsleft="1">
                    <description>A weapon made of pure force springs into existence and attacks opponents at a distance, as you direct it, dealing 1d8 force damage per hit, +1 point per three caster levels (maximum +5 at 15th level). The weapon takes the shape of a weapon favored by your deity or a weapon with some spiritual significance or symbolism to you (see below) and has the same threat range and critical multipliers as a real weapon of its form. It strikes the opponent you designate, starting with one attack in the round the spell is cast and continuing each round thereafter on your turn. It uses your base attack bonus (possibly allowing it multiple attacks per round in subsequent rounds) plus your Wisdom modifier as its attack bonus. It strikes as a spell, not as a weapon, so, for example, it can damage creatures that have damage reduction. As a force effect, it can strike incorporeal creatures without the normal miss chance associated with incorporeality. The weapon always strikes from your direction. It does not get a flanking bonus or help a combatant get one. Your feats (such as Weapon Focus) or combat actions (such as charge) do not affect the weapon. If the weapon goes beyond the spell range, if it goes out of your sight, or if you are not directing it, the weapon returns to you and hovers.

Each round after the first, you can use a move action to redirect the weapon to a new target. If you do not, the weapon continues to attack the previous roundâ€™s target. On any round that the weapon switches targets, it gets one attack. Subsequent rounds of attacking that target allow the weapon to make multiple attacks if your base attack bonus would allow it to. Even if the spiritual weapon is a ranged weapon, use the spellâ€™s range, not the weaponâ€™s normal range increment, and switching targets still is a move action.

A spiritual weapon cannot be attacked or harmed by physical attacks, but dispel magic, disintegrate, a sphere of annihilation, or a rod of cancellation affects it. A spiritual weaponâ€™s AC against touch attacks is 12 (10 + size bonus for Tiny object).

If an attacked creature has spell resistance, you make a caster level check (1d20 + caster level) against that spell resistance the first time the spiritual weapon strikes it. If the weapon is successfully resisted, the spell is dispelled. If not, the weapon has its normal full effect on that creature for the duration of the spell.

The weapon that you get is often a force replica of your deityâ€™s own personal weapon, many of which have individual names. A cleric without a deity gets a weapon based on his alignment. A neutral cleric without a deity can create a spiritual weapon of any alignment, provided he is acting at least generally in accord with that alignment at the time. The weapons associated with each alignment are as follows.

Chaos: Battleaxe
Evil: Flail
Good: Warhammer
Law: Longsword</description>

                    <description>You whisper a prayer to your deity, and his symbol appears in your hand. 

You conjure a small holy symbol, which you can then use to turn undead, or as a divine focus for spells, or for any other purpose that you would normally use one. The conjured holy symbol is made of wood and is neither magical nor particularly valuable.</description>

Updraft conjures forth rushing air that propels you upward. You gain 10 feet per level of altitude, and then gently float back down to the ground. At any point during your descent, you can move up to 5 feet laterally.</description>

                    <description>The transmuted creatures (one touched creature/level) can tread on any liquid as if it were firm ground. Mud, oil, snow, quicksand, running water, ice, and even lava can be traversed easily, since the subjectsâ€™ feet hover an inch or two above the surface. (Creatures crossing molten lava still take damage from the heat because they are near it.) The subjects can walk, run, charge, or otherwise move across the surface as if it were normal ground.

If the spell is cast underwater (or while the subjects are partially or wholly submerged in whatever liquid they are in), the subjects are borne toward the surface at 60 feet per round until they can stand on it.</description>
