                <description>Bronn Skyfall was born to a family of dwarves living in a small village nestled in the mountains. His father was a powerful green dragon who took on a dwarven form in order to be with his mother, a skilled blacksmith. Despite his dragon heritage, Bronn inherited his mother's dwarven blood and had a strong connection to the earth. However, his green, scaly skin often made him stand out and he was often teased and ostracized by his peers.

As a child, Bronn's parents fiercely protected him and taught him to channel his anger into becoming a skilled fighter. When he was just a teenager, his mother died defending the village from a group of goblins, and his father, devastated by her loss, left to wander the land. Determined to honor his parents' legacy and make a name for himself as a warrior, Bronn set out on his own journey and eventually joined a group of adventurers.

Bronn's older brother, Eilif, followed in the footsteps of their father and became a skilled blacksmith, while his sister, Nara, inherited her mother's love of magic and became a powerful sorceress. As he traveled the land, Bronn often found himself drawn to dragons and sought them out, hoping to learn more about his own heritage. He even defended dragons when they were threatened, using his strength and skill in combat to protect them. Bronn is a fierce and courageous warrior, always ready to stand up for what he believes in and fight for those in need.


As an adult, Bronn's reputation as a skilled fighter and dragon-blooded warrior grew, and he was eventually hired by a wealthy merchant to act as a bodyguard on a long journey through treacherous mountain passes. Along the way, Bronn encountered a group of bandits who attempted to rob the merchant's caravan. Bronn fought bravely to defend the merchant and his goods, ultimately driving off the bandits and earning the gratitude of his employer.

Bronn's love of dragons and desire to learn more about his own heritage led him to seek out and defend dragons when they were threatened. One such instance involved a group of hunters who were attempting to capture a young dragon for use as a mount. Bronn joined forces with the dragon and fought off the hunters, freeing the dragon and earning its gratitude.  The dragon's name was Arya.</description>

Check While the Knowledge (history) skill can represent a knowledge of warfare and tactics, this skill represents battlfield cunning and the ability to put tactics into action.  This skill also represents a general familiarity with tactics and can be used to perform any of the following actions.

Find Advantage: Once per round as a free action you may use this skill to find the quickest route to higher ground, cover, concealment, or an effective place to hide (gaining a +2 circumstance bonus to any Bluff checks used to create a diversion to hide this round).

Hunch: A successful check can reveal whether the enemy is fighting defensively to delay you, intends to concentrate on a specific objective, or simply wishes to retreat.  (If you have 5 or more ranks in Sense Motive, you gain a +2 synergy bonus to this check.)

Recognize Ambush: This use of the skill allows you to recognize areas that would make effective ambush points, allowing you to either avoid an ambush or organzie one of your own.  This only bestows a general wariness; detecting hidden attackers still requires a successful Spot check.

Find Advantage           15

                <skill name="Hypnosis" attrbonus="1" attrname="Charisma" value="1" ranks="0" trainedonly="yes" usable="no">
                    <description>You have studied the hidden workings of the human mind and can unlock its secrets.

Check: You can use hypnosis to induce a deep, calming trance in your subject. The effects of a hypnotic trance are identical to those created by the hypnotism spell.

Unlike the spell, however, the skill allows you to hypnotize only one target at a time, who does not receive the -2 penalty to her Will save. Each attempt to use hypnosis requires 1 hour. If the target is unwilling, you must first succeed at a Bluff check to disguise your intent.

A Hypnosis check is opposed by the target's Will save. Loud or distracting surroundings grant a +2 circumstance modifier to the target's Will save. Willing targets can voluntarily choose not to make their saving throw.

Once the target is hypnotized, you can either plant a suggestion (as per the hypnotism spell) or aid the recovery of a target who suffers from the effects of a failed Madness save. The latter option is detailed under "Recovering from Madness" in chapter 3.

Retry: Generally, you cannot retry a Hypnosis check against an unwilling target; the target becomes too suspicious to cooperate. If attempting to hypnotize a willing target, you may retry freely. Retries are a vital component in the process of helping targets recover from Madness effects, in fact.</description>

If you beat your target's check result, you may treat the target as friendly, but only for the purpose of actions taken while it remains intimidated.

Synergy: If you have 5 or more ranks in Bluff, you get a +2 bonus on Intimidate checks.</description>

                    <description>You can use this skill to identify martial maneuvers as soon as they are initiated.

Check: You can identify maneuvers and disciplines used by a combatant. The DCs for Martial Lore checks relating to various tasks are summarized below.

DC Task
10 + maneuver level: Identify a maneuver being initiated by someone you can see. No action required. No retry.
10 + maneuver level: Identify a maneuver recorded on a martial script. One try per day. Requires a full-round action.
20 + targetâ€™s initiator level: Determine all disciplines known by a particular creature by watching it initiate at least one maneuver. No action required. Retry only if the subject initiates another maneuver.

Action: Varies, as noted above.

Try Again: See above.

Check: You can attempt to disguise your voice as that of another person, or trick others into believing they have heard whatever creature sound you wish to mimic.  You must spend at least a day practicing your mimicry, or suffer a -5 circumstance penalty to your check.  You may not attempt to mimic people or creatures you have never heard before.  Anyone that hears you must make an opposed Listen check to realize that what they are hearing is not authentic.

Retry: Generally, once you have failed to fool a target you cannot fool him again.  Any further Mimic checks (emulating other voices or noises) against the same person during that encounter suffer a -2 penalty.

Special: If you have 6 or more ranks in Listen, you receive a +2 synergy bonus on Mimic checks.</description>

                    <description>Lore skills mix academic study with a broad overview of legend and superstition. Characters can attempt to use lore skills untrained (an Intelligence check, which the DM should roll) by relying on their knowledge of common folklore. However, folklore is often misleading. If a character trained in lore fails the skill check, she realizes that she simply does not know the needed information. If an untrained character fails the check, the DM should provide a skewed (or even dangerously unreliable) version of the desired information.</description>

This worn doeskin pouch holds a few unremarkable pebbles.

This pouch creates tiny pebbles that strike with the force of a catapult stone when thrown. Each stone has a range increment of 50 feet. You are proficient with the stones and must make a successful ranged attack to strike with one. A stone disappears after it completes its flight. Activating a bag of boulders is a standard action that includes both drawing and throwing a stone.

Each bag of boulders has 3 charges, which are renewed each day at dawn. Spending 1 or more charges when you draw a pebble from the bag determines the damage dealt by the stone when thrown.

1 charge: Deals 2d6 points of bludgeoning damage.
2 charges: Deals 3d6 points of bludgeoning damage.
3 charges: Deals 4d6 points of bludgeoning damage.

This pouch looks like itâ€™s seen its share of rough use. It is tattered and stained from use in the wild.

Five times per day, you can reach into a survival pouch and retrieve your choice of one of the following items. You can draw out the same item five times in one day, draw out five different items, or produce any combination of up to five items.

Each item lasts for 8 hours or until indicated below, whichever comes first.

â€¢ Trail rations for one Medium creature for one day.
â€¢ Two gallons of water stored in a waterskin. The waterskin disappears if it is emptied completely.
â€¢ A tent and two bedrolls sized for Medium creatures.
â€¢ A 50-foot coil of hempen rope.
â€¢ A shovel.
â€¢ A campfire (about 2 feet square). The fire can be left to burn, or it can be pulled apart to produce eight lit torches. Each removed torch lasts for 1 hour and reduces the remaining burning time of the campfire by 1 hour. If the fire is extinguished, the unburnt portion vanishes.
â€¢ A composite shortbow (+1 Str bonus) and a quiver of 20 arrows. The bow disappears 1 round after the last arrow has been drawn from the quiver.
â€¢ A mule with bit, bridle, saddle, and saddlebags (treat as a summoned creature, except that it will not fight for you).

                    <description>Iron spikes have a variety of uses, though they are most commonly hammered into door frames to keep doors shut.  If you have a hammer or mallet, you can pound one spike in place as a full round action.  A door with one spike in it is considered stuck, and a door with two or more spikes in it  is considered locked for the purposes of breaking it down.  (for the break DCs for stuck and locked doors, see Table 3-10:doors, DMG 61)</description>

                    <description>When you throw a tanglefoot bag at a creature (as a ranged touch attack with a range increment of 10 feet), the bag comes apart and the goo bursts out, entangling the target and then becoming tough and resilient upon exposure to air. An entangled creature takes a -2 penalty on attack rolls and a -4 penalty to Dexterity and must make a DC 15 Reflex save or be glued to the floor, unable to move. Even on a successful save, it can move only at half speed. Huge or larger creatures are unaffected by a tanglefoot bag. A flying creature is not stuck to the floor, but it must make a DC 15 Reflex save or be unable to fly (assuming it uses its wings to fly) and fall to the ground. A tanglefoot bag does not function underwater.
A creature that is glued to the floor (or unable to fly) can break free by making a DC 17 Strength check or by dealing 15 points of damage to the goo with a slashing weapon. A creature trying to scrape goo off itself, or another creature assisting, does not need to make an attack roll; hitting the goo is automatic, after which the creature that hit makes a damage roll to see how much of the goo was scraped off. Once free, the creature can move (including flying) at half speed. A character capable of spellcasting who is bound by the goo must make a DC 15 Concentration check to cast a spell. The goo becomes brittle and fragile after 2d4 rounds, cracking apart and losing its effectiveness. An application of universal solvent to a stuck creature dissolves the alchemical goo immediately.</description>

                    <description>A capsule retainer consists of a long leather thong that is wrapped around a melee or thrown (not projectile) weapon just at the base of the blade or striking surface and holds a thin, fitted metal ring that can hold one alchemical capsule.

Only one weapon capsule retainer can be attached to a weapon, and attaching it to the weapon or fitting a capsule into an empty retainer is a full round action that provokes attacks of opportunity. Using a capsule already equipped is a swift action that does not provoke attacks of opportunity.

Alchemical weapon capsules can also be filled with a single dose of any injury poison, allowing the wielder to poison his enemies. A character using poison in this way still faces all the normal risks of using poison (including accidental exposure when activating the capsule or with a natural 1 on any attack roll).</description>

                    <description>A creature that has the dragonblood subtype has a strong affinity to dragons. Which means that spells, effects, powers and abilities that effect or target dragons also effect it.

The subtype qualifies a creature to use magic items normally usuable only by dragons, and it qualifies the creature to take feats that have the subtype as a prerequisite.

The dragonblood subtype also makes creatures subject to harmful effects that affect dragons.

The dragonblood subtype does not confer the dragon type or any traits associated with that type. If a creature that has the dragonblood subtype somehow acquires the dragon type, it loses this subtype.</description>

                <special name="Type - Humanoid">
                    <description>A humanoid usually has two arms, two legs, and one head, or a humanlike torso, arms, and a head. Humanoids have few or no supernatural or extraordinary abilities, but most can speak and usually have well-developed societies. They usually are Small or Medium. Every humanoid creature also has a subtype.

Humanoids with 1 Hit Die exchange the features of their humanoid Hit Die for the class features of a PC or NPC class. Humanoids of this sort are presented as 1st-level warriors, which means that they have average combat ability and poor saving throws.

Humanoids with more than 1 Hit Die are the only humanoids who make use of the features of the humanoid type.

Features: A humanoid has the following features (unless otherwise noted in a creatureâ€™s entry).
â€”8-sided Hit Dice, or by character class.
â€”Base attack bonus equal to 3/4 total Hit Dice (as cleric).
â€”Good Reflex saves (usually; a humanoidâ€™s good save varies).
â€”Skill points equal to (2 + Int modifier, minimum 1) per Hit Die, with quadruple skill points for the first Hit Die, or by character class.

Traits: A humanoid possesses the following traits (unless otherwise noted in a creatureâ€™s entry).
â€”Proficient with all simple weapons, or by character class.
â€”Proficient with whatever type of armor (light, medium, or heavy) it is described as wearing, or by character class. If a humanoid does not have a class and wears armor, it is proficient with that type of armor and all lighter types. Humanoids not indicated as wearing armor are not proficient with armor. Humanoids are proficient with shields if they are proficient with any form of armor.
â€”Humanoids breathe, eat, and sleep.</description>

                            <description>This special quality allows a creature to detect approaching enemies, sniff out hidden foes, and track by sense of smell. Creatures with the scent ability can identify familiar odors just as humans do familiar sights.

The creature can detect opponents within 30 feet by sense of smell. If the opponent is upwind, the range increases to 60 feet; if downwind, it drops to 15 feet. Strong scents, such as smoke or rotting garbage, can be detected at twice the ranges noted above. Overpowering scents, such as skunk musk or troglodyte stench, can be detected at triple normal range.

When a creature detects a scent, the exact location of the source is not revealedâ€”only its presence somewhere within range. The creature can take a move action to note the direction of the scent. Whenever the creature comes within 5 feet of the source, the creature pinpoints the sourceâ€™s location.

A creature with the Track feat and the scent ability can follow tracks by smell, making a Wisdom (or Survival) check to find or follow a track. The typical DC for a fresh trail is 10 (no matter what kind of surface holds the scent). This DC increases or decreases depending on how strong the quarryâ€™s odor is, the number of creatures, and the age of the trail. For each hour that the trail is cold, the DC increases by 2. The ability otherwise follows the rules for the Track feat. Creatures tracking by scent ignore the effects of surface conditions and poor visibility.</description>

                            <description>You can appraise common or well-known objects with a DC 12 Appraise check. Failure means that you estimate the value at 50% to 150% of its actual value.

Check While the Knowledge (history) skill can represent a knowledge of warfare and tactics, this skill represents battlfield cunning and the ability to put tactics into action.  This skill also represents a general familiarity with tactics and can be used to perform any of the following actions.

Find Advantage: Once per round as a free action you may use this skill to find the quickest route to higher ground, cover, concealment, or an effective place to hide (gaining a +2 circumstance bonus to any Bluff checks used to create a diversion to hide this round).

Hunch: A successful check can reveal whether the enemy is fighting defensively to delay you, intends to concentrate on a specific objective, or simply wishes to retreat.  (If you have 5 or more ranks in Sense Motive, you gain a +2 synergy bonus to this check.)

Recognize Ambush: This use of the skill allows you to recognize areas that would make effective ambush points, allowing you to either avoid an ambush or organzie one of your own.  This only bestows a general wariness; detecting hidden attackers still requires a successful Spot check.

Find Weakness: An opposed Battle check against the leader of an enemy army to find a weakness in the opponent's strategy.

Battle Task            DC
Find Advantage           15

                            <description>You have studied the hidden workings of the human mind and can unlock its secrets.

Check: You can use hypnosis to induce a deep, calming trance in your subject. The effects of a hypnotic trance are identical to those created by the hypnotism spell.

Unlike the spell, however, the skill allows you to hypnotize only one target at a time, who does not receive the -2 penalty to her Will save. Each attempt to use hypnosis requires 1 hour. If the target is unwilling, you must first succeed at a Bluff check to disguise your intent.

A Hypnosis check is opposed by the target's Will save. Loud or distracting surroundings grant a +2 circumstance modifier to the target's Will save. Willing targets can voluntarily choose not to make their saving throw.

Once the target is hypnotized, you can either plant a suggestion (as per the hypnotism spell) or aid the recovery of a target who suffers from the effects of a failed Madness save. The latter option is detailed under "Recovering from Madness" in chapter 3.

Retry: Generally, you cannot retry a Hypnosis check against an unwilling target; the target becomes too suspicious to cooperate. If attempting to hypnotize a willing target, you may retry freely. Retries are a vital component in the process of helping targets recover from Madness effects, in fact.</description>

Your Intimidate check is opposed by the target's modified level check (1d20 + character level or Hit Dice + target's Wisdom bonus [if any] + target's modifiers on saves against fear). If you beat your target's check result, you may treat the target as friendly, but only for the purpose of actions taken while it remains intimidated.

Synergy: If you have 5 or more ranks in Bluff, you get a +2 bonus on Intimidate checks.</description>

                            <description>You can reproduce the voices of others, or the sounds made by creatures you have heard.

Check: You can attempt to disguise your voice as that of another person, or trick others into believing they have heard whatever creature sound you wish to mimic.  You must spend at least a day practicing your mimicry, or suffer a -5 circumstance penalty to your check.  You may not attempt to mimic people or creatures you have never heard before.  Anyone that hears you must make an opposed Listen check to realize that what they are hearing is not authentic.

Retry: Generally, once you have failed to fool a target you cannot fool him again.  Any further Mimic checks (emulating other voices or noises) against the same person during that encounter suffer a -2 penalty.

Special: If you have 6 or more ranks in Listen, you receive a +2 synergy bonus on Mimic checks.</description>
